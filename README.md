Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis - Create customer profiles for a targeted marketing strategy

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but more information about their sales pattern remained uncovered. 
I would like to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to 1) figure out the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behavior and 2) create customer profiles for a targeted marketing strategy.
